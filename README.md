# Anonymous Reporting System – Python

Console-based anonymous reporting system developed in Python for academic purposes.

The system allows users to submit anonymous reports with different types and severity levels,
validates input data such as dates and text length, and includes an administrative panel
to review reports, detect false reports, and display basic statistics.

## Features
- Anonymous report submission
- Report classification by type and severity
- Date validation
- Detection of potentially false reports using keywords
- Administrative panel with filters and statistics

## Technologies
- Python

## Purpose
Academic project created to practice programming logic, conditional structures,
loops, input validation, and basic data management.

## Future Improvements
- Store reports persistently using JSON
- Improve false report detection logic
- Modularize the system using functions
- Enhance admin authentication
